## Initial problem statement
Something something... I want to run an computer experiment about a model that I've developed... but how do I generate samples from $N\sim (0, 1)$?

## What are Monte Carlo methods?
- Type 1 (Primitive) & Type 2 Monte Carlo Methods

## Under what conditions *can* we generate samples from a probability distribution?
When the cumulative density function is invertible.

## Damn! All the useful distributions are non-invertible!
Enter rejection sampling, importance sampling 

## Personal Thoughts
- This shit is hard. It took me litarlly like 3 months worth of working on this topic to actually understand what the fuck was going on.
